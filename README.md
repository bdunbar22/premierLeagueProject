# premierLeagueProject
Database Design final project


Ben Dunbar, Jike Fang, Filmon Elias 

A website allowing users to interact with a database containing info
about the premier soccer league. 

The database will be designed by the project team and data will be imported from csv files found online after analysis and editing has been done to the files. 

Just testing a change.
